# ameyxyz-Dynamic-Sorting-Visualizer

🔄 Dynamic Sorting Visualizer
📌 Project Overview
Dynamic Sorting Visualizer is a fully responsive, interactive web application that helps users understand and learn common sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations and animations. It provides an intuitive interface to observe how data gets sorted step-by-step, making it a powerful tool for students and learners of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Objectives
✅ Build a visual and interactive learning tool for sorting algorithms.
🎨 Animate the sorting process to show internal operations in real time.
🔁 Allow users to choose between different algorithms and customize sorting speed and array size.
📱 Ensure responsive design for all device sizes.
📘 Improve conceptual understanding through visual and textual insights.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
💡 Features
🔄 Multiple Sorting Algorithms
Visualize and compare different sorting strategies.
🎥 Real-Time Animations
Each swap, comparison, and placement is animated in real time.
🖱️ User Controls
Start, pause, reset animation
Change algorithm
Adjust sorting speed
Change number of elements
📱 Responsive Web Design
Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
📘 Live Algorithm Insight
Highlights which elements are being compared/swapped with explanations for each step.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Sorting Algorithms Implemented
1. 🔁 Bubble Sort
Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Simple but inefficient for large data sets.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

3. 📥 Insertion Sort
Builds a sorted array one item at a time by comparing the current item to those before it and inserting it into its correct position.
Efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

3. 🔃 Selection Sort
Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted section and moves it to the correct position.
Performs well on small arrays but has poor performance on large datasets.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure of the web pages
CSS3	Styling and responsive layout
JavaScript	Core logic for sorting & animations
Bootstrap (optional)	Layout and responsive components
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚀 How It Works
User selects a sorting algorithm from a dropdown menu.
Random array is generated and displayed as vertical bars.
On clicking “Start”, the animation begins showing each step of the sort.
During the sorting:
Comparisons are shown in a different color.
Swaps are visually animated.
Insights (e.g., "Swapping 15 and 8") are shown on screen.
Once sorted, the bars turn green to indicate completion.

📁 Future Enhancements
🔄 Add more algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
🎙️ Add voice-over explanations.
📈 Show complexity charts alongside animations.
💾 Save user preferences.
